A personal collection of Python convenience functions for styling data displays and outputs, transforming and organizing data, performing statistical analyses, and other commonly performed actions in data science projects.

Releases of the package can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pycodebox
```

or development versions (which may or may not line up with official releases) from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/zwallen/PyCodeBox.git
```

And imported in your Python scripts as follows:

```python
from pycodebox import export_styled_xlsx_w_2_headers, fisher_exact_by_strata
```

## Changelog

Version 0.1.9 (current)
* Updated formatting of code
* Modified `stratified_volcano_plot` and `pca_kmeans_plot` functions to handle single categories/plots better

Version 0.1.8
* Added function `pca_kmeans_plot` and corresponding testing of function to perform PCA and K-means clustering, returning a plot of the results and a contingency table if a known group variable is provided

Version 0.1.7
* Added function `read_tab_delim_file_to_dict` to read a tab-delimited file line by line to a dictionary (useful for files that do not have the same number of fields per row)

Version 0.1.6
* Converted plotting functions to use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` instead of `plotnine`
* Added statistical testing and plotting of significant associations to `stratified_barplot` and `stratified_violin_boxplot` functions
* Fixed docstrings of all functions so they render correctly

Version 0.1.5
* Added stratified volcano plot function and associated testing

Version 0.1.3
* Fixed spacing issues and fine tuned plotting functions
* Updated docstrings across functions

Version 0.1.2
* Updated plotting functions to be more dynamic in some of the text placement
* Updated testing of plotting functions to include both required only and full parameter testing

Version 0.1.1
* Updated package name to `pycodebox` to avoid conflicts with existing packages on PyPI
* Successful upload to PyPI, so package can now be installed via `pip install pycodebox`

Version 0.1.0
