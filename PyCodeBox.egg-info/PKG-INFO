A personal collection of Python convenience functions for styling data displays and outputs, transforming and organizing data, performing statistical analyses, and other commonly performed actions in data science projects.

Releases of the package can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pycodebox
```

or development versions (which may or may not line up with official releases) from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/zwallen/PyCodeBox.git
```

And imported in your Python scripts as follows:

```python
from pycodebox import export_styled_xlsx_w_2_headers, fisher_exact_by_strata
```

As these are only personal convenience functions wrapping existing functions and packages:

* **Compatibility:** They may or may not work for your purposes as they were designed in response to specific workflows and analyses. They are not meant to be designed for general audience use.
* **Support:** Limited support is provided - use at your own risk and test thoroughly with your data.
* **Citation:** Citation of the package is not necessary if you decide to use any of the functions written here (but glad if they were able to help!).
